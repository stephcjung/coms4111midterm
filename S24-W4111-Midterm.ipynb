    "\n",
    "Metadata describes data that provides information about the organization and properties of other data. Codd's 0th Rule means that for RDBMSs, metadata is stored in tables within the database itself, and users can query and manipulate this data (for example using SQL). \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples: Users can query the system catalog tables to retrieve metadata about the database schema. The SQL query \"describe classicmodels.customers;\" produces a table with information about the attributes in the table *customers*, including the attributes' data types and key-types.\n",
    "\n",

    "    vendorLastName varchar(25),\n",
    "    vendorFirstName varchar(25)\n",
    ");\"\n",
    "creates a new table called *vendors* in the **classicmodels** schema. It also accordingly updates the metadata in the **classicmodels** schema (such as updating information_schema.TABLES to include the new vendor table).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Security\n",
    "\n",
    "Security describes the system of controlling access to the database and ensuring data confidentiality, availability, and integrity. Codd's 0th Rule means that a RDBMS must execute its security measures using its relational capabilities; using tables, it must be able to define user roles, permissions, and access. For example, authorization (what a user is allowed to do to data) can be assigned to users on different parts/tables within the database through SQL statements. The statement \"**grant delete on** *department* to *John*;\" allows the user John to delete tuples from the relation *department*. If a user is not authorized for a query/update, when the user attempts to carry it out SQL will reject the query/update. User authentication is also carried out through a database's relational capabilities. In a hidden metadata table, user IDs and their passwords are stored securely using a hash function; when a user tries to login, the user's inputted password is hashed and compared with the stored hash in the database. If the hashes match, the user is authenticated and allowed access; if they do not match, the user is denied access to the database. \n",
    "\n",

This causes additional overhead cost compared to updates on atomic keys. Non-atomic keys essentially decrease the performance and effectiveness of indexes since indexes are meant to speed up query execution, and non-atomic keys can cause slower index traversal and lookup operations (as well as an increase in the storage needed for the indexes)."

Natural join looks at the Cartesian product of two relations, then creates a new table containing only those tuples that have the same value on those shared attributes. Natural join does not repeat those shared attributes (it only keeps one of the common columns).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Equi-join combines two relations based on the equality of values in certain columns (specified in the join condition). It returns a new table with only the rows where the values of the specifed columns from the two relations are equal. Equi-join is a specific form of inner join in which the join condition must be an equality.\n",

    "3. Theta join combines two relations based on a specified join condition that is an arbitrary predicate not limited to equality. It returns a new table with only those tuples where the values of the specified columns fulfill the join condition. Theta join is a more general form of inner join.\n",

    "4. Left join preserves all the rows from the left table (first table in the join clause).

Outer join combines and keeps rows with matching values in the columns specified by the join condition. If a value from one table's column does not have a matching value in the other table's specified column, NULL values are included for the columns of the table without a match.\n",

If the foreign key clause of *orderdetails* includes the cascade actions **on delete cascade** and **on update cascade**, this is helpful because then if we want to update a tuple's orderNumber or delete a tuple with a certain orderNumber, we only have to do so in the relation *orders*. Due to cascading, this change will also be carried out on the tuple with that same orderNumber in the table *orderdetails*.

If the song has not been removed from the playlist, the value for date_removed is NULL.

To view the history of a user's current and previous reviews for an album, you can query *Review* and filter the rows based on the desired user_id and album_id.
