This repo includes my midterm for the course COMS4111 Intro to Databases. Question types include conceptual questions and database term definitions, ER modeling, relational algebra expressions, and SQL (data and schema cleanup and queries).

This midterm has already been given out and completed and is NOT for the purpose of spreading exam materials. This repo is meant to demonstrate database and SQL knowledge and understanding.
